             <h3>Context & Problem statement</h3>
              <p>Whatever your opinion is about inking up, tattoos are intimately linked with personal emotion and visual communication. Something that fascinated me, as I couldn't ever make up my mind about getting tattooed, or not getting tattooed. That is indeed one question.</p>
              <p>If the answer is Yes, a series of further questions follows: What kind of tattoo? On which body part? In which tattoo studio? And, what if regrets come?</p>
              <p>Tattoo enthusiasts need a way to find the one tattoo design, which they may even not visualized yet, because the tattoo reflects an important part of them - their emotional world.</p>
              <p>My Tattoo World is the solution I designed for those people.</p>

             <h3>Strategic Goals</h3>
              <p>After having identified the digital solutions tattoo enthusiasts currently have, I wondered why not creating an allrounder app which combines all these features: search for tattoo designers and booking option, search for inspirations (henna and inked tattoos) and virtual tattoo test.</p>
              <p>On this basis I defined the strategic goals as follow:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>develop and launch an attractive, well designed and useful application;</li>
              <li>activate the community of women with tattoos;</li>
              <li>attract the attention of the designers and the end users;</li>
              <li>be the best app for women with tattoos.</li>
              </ul>

             <h3>User Stories vs. User Interviews</h3>
             <p>With some ideas what could be helpful to our potential users, I interviewed 5 women selected according to our target group definition (aged above 25-30 years, already tattooed).</p>
             <p>The objective: Verify my ideas by knowing my potential users and by understanding their emotions, their decision process, and their specific needs as women. And indeed, it was a revelation!</p>
             <p>For example our users don't identify with the tattoo community at all. Thus, they have no need to share something with other "members". This insight was the cause of the premature death of the chat feature I thought about.</p>

             <h3>User Persona</h3>
             <p>Clearly many of these women are like Jacinthe Norson, one of the two personas created for this project. They have and want only a few tattoos. They associate something very strong with them: independence, self-confidence and pride.</p>
             <p>Thus, the search process for the one tattoo design is the first and most important step. This is what I had in mind when drawing Jacinthe's user journey and user flow - taking a particular attention to her emotions.</p>

             <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
             <p>Based on the user flows, I worked next on the sitemap of the app by involving users via the quantitative research method called card sorting. Obviously different people - different ways of clustering ideas: there weren't so many similarities in the answers gathered. That is why I adapted my original sitemap and changed it to a rather flat structure, so that every user can find a way to the information needed.</p>

             <h3>Wireframing</h3>
             <p>Now I could start drawing first sketches on paper of how the app could look like later. Step by step the drawings became a prototype - clickable screens which test users went through during the usability tests.</p>

             <h3>Usability Test</h3>
             <p>Despite the overall good acceptance of the app and its features, I had several changes to work on which I prioritized by severity. This is the summary shown in the so called Rainbow Spreadsheet allowing a constructive improvement of the app starting by the most critical aspects first.</p>

             <h4>Home screen</h4>
             <p>Maybe you've asked yourself while looking at the low-fidelity wireframes above what is the meaning of the light bulb in the navigation bottom bar? An idea?</p>
             <p>That was my intention to symbolize the ideas and inspiration Jacinthe will look for when entering the app, and as it is the feature I thought that the light bulb as icon could replace the standard one for Home. But I was wrong even after having added a subtitle. This is a clear statement for the strength of design patterns.</p>

              <h3>Iterative Process</h3>
              <p>As you can see a tremendous work has been made. It is an iterative learning and optimization process. Analogous changes were made on further screens touching at the three main features of My Tattoo World app: Search for inspiration, Virtual tattoo test and Book an appointment.</p>

                <h4>Search feature</h4>
                <p>The idea to have a direct access to the Photo Gallery when entering the app, so that Jacinthe can start right away with her search, is still there.</p>
                <p>However the text in the Search bar had to be reformulated, so that the user understands what she can expect: a Style Library.</p>

                 <h4>Virtual tattoo test feature</h4>
                 <p>A great feature for the user who wants to be sure to have the right tattoo design, although this option is not well known. Due to that the users asked during the usability test couldn't find easily how to access to the feature. And there the upload option was surprising, as users would expect to be able to use pictures from the app.</p>
                 <p>Now an orange button on the Home screen invites the user - logged in or not - to try a tattoo virtually. In the next step the user can choose the source of selection of the picture.</p>

                 <h4>Booking feature</h4>
                 <p>For pragmatic people who expect to have an app for everything, this feature is a must. But speaking about tattoo a lot of information are needed, so that the designer can evaluate how much time he/she will need and how much time the tattoo session will last. That was the challenge here not to overwhelm the user. That is why the process has been reviewed and splitted in 4 steps clearly indicated by the step indicator.</p>

The Design Language System represents indeed the spirit of the app in form of the design elements, the colors, the fonts and the language used.</p>

               <h3>Project Learnings</h3>
               <p>Especially in the field of user research, I realized how much the quality of the outcome depends on the level of preparation. A good prepared questionnaire for interviews is mandatory, in order to get relevant insights and be able to make comparison afterwards.</p>
               <p>Also I realized how much learning effect the users have by using regularly applications, so that designing a bit differently than the standard has to be well thought (i.e. light bulb icon).</p>
